# dotfiles
All my dotfiles in one handy location!

## My Setup
Most of my work is done on a Mac, though I use a number of these files on Linux and even a bit on Windows.

On my Mac, I use:
* iTerm 2
* zsh
* Vim

Most of the dotfiles and configurations enable a faster, more beautiful experience when I'm using the above.
